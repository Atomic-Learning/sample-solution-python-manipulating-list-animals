<p>Let's create a list of animals and see how we can modify it.</p>
<py-cell>
animals = ["rabbit", "hamster"]
print(animals)
</py-cell>

<p>We can add a new animal to the end of the list using <code>append()</code>.</p>
<py-cell>
animals.append("rat")
print(animals)
</py-cell>

<p>To add an animal at the beginning, use <code>insert()</code> with index 0.</p>
<py-cell>
animals.insert(0, "chinchilla")
print(animals)
</py-cell>

<p>We can combine two lists using the <code>+</code> operator. This creates a new list and leaves the originals unchanged.</p>
<py-cell>
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "bread"]
combined = animals + shopping_list
print(combined)
print(animals)  # Original list unchanged
print(shopping_list)   # Original list unchanged
</py-cell>

<p>Trying to access an index that doesn't exist will raise an <code>IndexError</code>.</p>
<py-cell>
print(animals[99])
</py-cell>

<p>Trying to assign a value to an index that doesn't exist will also raise an <code>IndexError</code>.</p>
<py-cell>
animals[99] = "alligator"
</py-cell>
